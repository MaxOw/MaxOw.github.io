####Hey there interwebs traveller!

My name is Maksymillian Owsianny. I'm a software engineer.
I'm interested in Type Theory and general software correctness and
also in procedural graphics generation.

You can reach me at **Maksymilian** dot **Owsianny** at **gmail** dot **com**.

The style of this blog is based on (or rather ruthlessly taken from)
[Stephen Diehl's] webpage. He has lots of great Haskell content so be
sure to check it out.
